# holo

`holo` is my **personal utility library**, built over time to centralize and reuse a wide range of tools, functions, and helpers across my projects.  
Whenever I develop a function or module that I find useful in multiple contexts, I add it here.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This package is **not version-stable**. Breaking changes may occur at any time, and compatibility between versions is not guaranteed.

## üì¶ About the Project

`holo` is designed to be **modular**, **practical**, and focused on **developer productivity**.  
It includes general-purpose utilities spanning math, cryptography, plotting, profiling, parallelism, file I/O, custom languages, and more.

This repository is not intended to be a public library or a pip-installable package (yet), but rather a **consolidated toolbox** for my personal and experimental projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

- Codebase mixes **pure Python** and **Cython** for performance-sensitive parts.
- Internal type definitions are maintained in `__typing.py`.
- The project includes a Cython setup (`compile_cython_setup.py`) to compile C extensions.
- Used extensively in my own projects (tools, experiments, automation).

## üöß Status

- **Actively evolving** with new ideas, tools, and optimizations.
- Some modules are more stable, others are experimental or prototypes.
- Documentation is sparse, but types and naming aim for clarity.
